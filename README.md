# ConcaveMirror-FocalLength-Calculator (Java Program)

This repository contains a **Java program to calculate and validate the focal length of a concave mirror** using user input. It was implemented as part of **Question 2 – WAKISHA MOCK Physics Integration Task** in the **Java OOP October 2025 Examination**.

---

##  **Program Description**

The program:
- Accepts **object distance (u)** and **image distance (v)** from the user.
- Ensures **u is negative** (rule for concave mirrors) and **v is positive**.
- Computes focal length using **Mirror Formula**:

\[
f = \frac{u \times v}{u + v}
\]

- Checks if **21 cm ≤ f ≤ 25 cm** and prints **ACCEPTABLE** or **NOT ACCEPTABLE**.
